  "summary": "REQ-53 and REQ-54 appear implemented via referentially-stable validation callbacks (useCallback in RegistrationFlow and ref-based callback usage in step components) and a new RegistrationStepErrorBoundary with English error text + Refresh action. REQ-52 appears partially addressed by forcing a RegistrationFlow remount when navigating back from Admin to Registration and guarding step range, but the diff is truncated so full confirmation of Step 1 always rendering after splash is limited. The diff also introduces multiple unrequested functional changes (notably a new conditional payment receipt requirement in Step 2 and substantial Admin/print/CSS/Tailwind changes).",
