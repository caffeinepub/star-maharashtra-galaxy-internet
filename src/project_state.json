    "Registration is a 4-step flow: Details -> Document Upload -> Terms -> OTP Verification",
    "Add an Admin Panel for viewing saved registrations, restricted to a single admin user (access control mechanism TBD).",
    "Add an animated splash screen shown on app launch before navigating to the main registration flow/admin panel.",
    "Splash/intro screen should remove the logo and instead display the company name in stylized/design lettering (text-based branding).",
    "Splash screen company name text (no logo) should use an updated font and include color styling.",
    "Add conditional receipt upload: when Payment Option = Online, require user to upload a payment-success receipt photo (PhonePe/Google Pay) before completing registration.",
    "Provide a printable/exportable Terms & Conditions proof for the customer (e.g., print dialog / downloadable receipt) from the Terms step after acceptance.",
    "Splash/intro screen animation background should use a space/galaxy blue color theme.",
    "Admin username/password login success should auto-redirect to a customer registration detail/editing view (directly opening customer details) to support quick edits when setup-code unlock is failing.",

    "Password field visibility toggle (eye icon) is still not present/added on the login form as expected.",

    "Admin Panel: Uploaded document photos (Aadhaar/PAN/receipt) are not visible in the registration detail view (user reports they cannot see the document photos)."
