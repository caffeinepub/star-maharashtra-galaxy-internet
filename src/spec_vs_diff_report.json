  "summary": "REQ-41 and REQ-42 are largely implemented: SplashScreen company name is split into words with a new display font class (font-display) and multi-color styling per word via new CSS classes. However, the diff also introduces broader theme/style changes and additional splash animations, and it is not clearly shown that reduced-motion mode disables animations while keeping the new font/color styling.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-42",
      "requirement": "In reduced-motion mode (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce), the new font and color styling still apply, and animations remain disabled as currently implemented.",
      "reason": "The diff adds multiple splash animations (e.g., shimmer, entrance, fade-in) but the provided CSS does not show any @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) overrides to disable these animations. SplashScreen.tsx reads the preference, but only uses it to shorten the auto-complete duration, not to disable CSS animations.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-41",
      "requirement": "The splash screen continues to auto-transition, fade out, and allow skipping as before (preserve existing behavior).",
      "reason": "SplashScreen.tsx changes the auto-complete timing based on reduced-motion (2000ms vs 4000ms). If the prior behavior was a fixed duration, this is a behavior change; the diff does not provide evidence that this matches the previous behavior.",

      "description": "Global theme/token changes (OKLCH color system variables) beyond splash company name styling.",
      "reason": "The request is limited to splash company name font/color styling and explicitly avoids changing the overall app theme outside that scope. index.css shows extensive changes to :root and .dark CSS variables (primary/accent/etc.) which affect the whole app.",

    },
    {
      "description": "Added/expanded splash animations (text shimmer, glow effects, multiple keyframes) beyond the requested font and color styling.",
      "reason": "REQ-41/42 ask for font and color styling while preserving existing behavior; the diff adds new keyframes and applies new animations to company name and tagline.",

        "frontend/src/index.css"

    {
      "description": "Unrequested unrelated feature summaries/state updates mentioning admin panel and other functionality.",
