  "summary": "REQ-96 is partially implemented: the splash screen component now renders the company name string, retains click-to-skip, fade-out, auto-timeout, and reduced-motion handling. However, the rendered text is forced to uppercase via CSS (so it will not display with the exact capitalization required), and the diff introduces additional UI/visual elements (Skip button, decorative circles) that were not requested and may violate the non-goals.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-96",
      "requirement": "Display the company name text exactly as \"Star Maharashtra Galaxy Internet\" (matching spelling and capitalization) as the primary branding text.",
      "reason": "The heading applies the Tailwind class `uppercase`, which will render the text as all-caps, not with the exact capitalization specified in the requirement/AC.",

      "requirement": "Do not change the splash screen background theme/animations beyond what is required to update the displayed company name text.",

      "description": "Added a visible \"Skip\" button on the splash screen (in addition to click/tap anywhere).",
      "reason": "REQ-96 only requires preserving click/tap-to-skip behavior; adding new splash UI controls is not requested and may be considered a splash asset/UI change beyond the text update.",
