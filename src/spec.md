# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the app’s splash/intro animation branding text to display the full company name “Star Maharashtra Galaxy Internet”.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current splash screen branding text (“SMGI” / “Network Solutions”) with exactly: “Star Maharashtra Galaxy Internet”.
- Ensure existing splash behavior remains unchanged: auto-transition timing, fade-out, click/tap-to-skip, and prefers-reduced-motion handling.

**User-visible outcome:** On app launch, users see “Star Maharashtra Galaxy Internet” as the primary splash screen text, can still tap/click to skip, and the splash still fades out and transitions on the same timing (including reduced-motion behavior).
